# Documentation

A brief introduction to Picnic CSS. This guide is written in a manner to make it easy to maintain, so it might lack explicit links and versions in favour of pointing where you will find those.


## Getting started

Picnic comes in two compiled flavours, `picnic.css` (the library) and `plugins.css` (library + plugins). Also, you can get the developer SCSS files to personalize your website as much as you want. To install it:

**Bower**: the package manager is the easiest way to install Picnic's developer files. Simply do:

    bower install picnic

Use **[Picnic from jsdelivr](http://www.jsdelivr.com/#!picnicss)** to get the compiled and minimized file.

Go to **[github's minimized file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/picnicss/picnic/master/releases/picnic.min.css)** or just **[clone the whole project](https://github.com/picnicss/picnic)**.
