# Picnic CSS Versions

From newer to older



## Version 2.0 [planned]

- `<main>`: Make it responsive by default
- `<footer>`: The body scrolls up while showing it from behind
- `fonts`: Set a default nice font from Google fonts



## Version 1.1

- Complete testing page that can be [seen here](http://picnicss.com/test/) and [here the flat version](http://picnicss.com/test/flat/).

- Added SASS variables and behaviour:
  - `$invasive: true;` sets the default behaviour as invasive. If false, you'll need to add classes like `button`.
  - `$deep: true;` sets 3d for buttons and forms. If false, the buttons will be flat.
  - Breakpoints, colors, paddings, margins, etc

- Made the *risky* elements optional: *selects*, *radiobuttons* and *checkboxes*.

- Fixed many bugs


## Version 1.0

Initial version released on Hacker News. It had several bugs, most of them solved by the community.
